# TASK 1 : CRITERIONS

1. Notebook1 : [Linear_regression_1.ipynb](https://github.com/akhilagrawal1001/Pclub-Secy-Task1/blob/master/Linear_regression_1.ipynb)

    ### Loss : | x - x' | <sup>3</sup>

    #### Created the dataset within code, where x is a random array of 1000 elements between 0 and 1, and y is obtained by mapping x through a simple function `y = mx + c`

    ### Results

    The loss obtained after training is : **3.2463822194590294e-05**

    The plot of ground truth v/s predicted value for test data ( generated in same manner as train data ) :

3. Notebook3 : [Polynomial_regression_1.ipynb](https://github.com/akhilagrawal1001/Pclub-Secy-Task1/blob/master/Polynomial_regression_1.ipynb)

    ### Loss : | x - x' |<sup>4</sup>

    #### Created the dataset within code, where x is a random array of 1000 elements between 0 and 1, and y is obtained by mapping x through a simple function `y = w1.x1 + w2.x2 + c` where x1 = x and x2 = x<sup>2</sup> 
    > Such function because we want to train a polynomial regression model with degree 2
